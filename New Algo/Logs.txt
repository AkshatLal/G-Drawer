Work done:
	Made the code modular
	Implemented Partitioning path (to be verified)
	Debugged West most path (to be verified)
	Optimized code (changed get_outer_face function)

Next step:
	Implement draw algorithm recursively

Notes:
	Fix the get_dual code and vertex_to_edge mapping function. Change enumeration from alphabetical to numerical (causes error when Dual graph has more than 26 vertices)
